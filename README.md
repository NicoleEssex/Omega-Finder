# Omega-Finder
How many times have you found yourself needing a restroom but weren't sure where the nearest one was? Omega-Finder is a mobile app that locates the nearest one to you and gives you ratings for, and a option to leave a rating along with a brief comment, for each bathroom you use. Based on your geolocation Omega-Finder utilizes google maps and our custom Omega symbol for the restrooms near you.
Below are the screen shots that walk you through the application each page at a time.
